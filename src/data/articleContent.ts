    title: 'Phase 1: The Art of Calm & Renew',
    heroImage: '/images/phase-calm-hero.jpg',
    bodyText: "During your period (Days 1-7), the hormones estrogen and progesterone are at their lowest levels. This can cause your skin's protective barrier to weaken, leading to dryness, sensitivity, and redness. Your skin is vulnerable and needs gentle care. Our goal during this phase is not to 'attack' problems, but to soothe, hydrate, and rebuild. Think of it as a comfort blanket for your skin."

    heroImage: '/images/phase-glow-hero.jpg',
    bodyText: "During ovulation (Days 8-14), estrogen reaches its peak. Your skin is at its strongest, most resilient, and most radiant. Collagen production is optimized, and your complexion naturally glows. This is the perfect time to leverage your skin's power with active ingredients and treatments that deliver maximum results. Think of this phase as your skin's 'performance window.'"

    title: 'Phase 3: The Art of Balance & Clarify',
    heroImage: '/images/phase-balance-hero.jpg',
    bodyText: "In the luteal phase (Days 15+), progesterone dominates. This hormone increases sebum production, which can lead to clogged pores, breakouts, and a heavier complexion. Your skin needs clarifying, balancing care to manage excess oil and prevent blemishes. Our goal is to keep your skin clear and balanced without stripping it."

    title: 'Ingredient Spotlight: What are Ceramides?',
    heroImage: '/images/ceramides-hero.jpg',
    bodyText: "Think of your skin cells as 'bricks.' Ceramides are the 'mortar' that holds them together. These essential lipids create a protective barrier that locks moisture in and keeps pollutants out. When this barrier is damaged, your skin becomes dry, itchy, and irritated. Our Ceramide Concentrate and Calm & Renew Serum are packed with these building blocks to physically repair your barrier and restore comfort."

    title: 'The Cellular Training Rhythm: Explained',
    heroImage: '/images/phase-calm-hero.jpg',
    bodyText: "After menopause, your skin no longer follows hormonal cycles, but it still has rhythm‚Äîa cellular rhythm. Just as athletes train their muscles with different exercises on different days, your skin cells benefit from varied 'training' throughout the week.\n\nOur 7-Day Cellular Training Rhythm is designed around the scientifically-proven concept of skin cycling: alternating active treatments with recovery periods to maximize results while minimizing irritation.\n\nDays 1 & 2: Recovery Nights - We strengthen your barrier with calming, nourishing ingredients.\n\nDay 3: Exfoliation Night - We gently remove dead cells to boost renewal.\n\nDay 4: Activation Night - We deliver potent antioxidants and active ingredients when your skin is perfectly prepared.\n\nDays 5 & 6: Recovery Nights - We allow your skin to rest and repair after activation.\n\nDay 7: Flex Night - We address specific needs or provide additional recovery.\n\nThis rhythm respects your skin's need for both challenge and rest, creating a sustainable, effective routine that builds strength over time."

    title: 'Understanding Your Skin in Menopause',
    heroImage: '/images/phase-glow-hero.jpg',
    bodyText: "Menopause brings profound changes to your skin, driven by the consistent decline in estrogen levels. Understanding these changes empowers you to address them effectively.\n\nKey Changes:\n\n1. Reduced Collagen Production: Estrogen stimulates collagen synthesis. Without it, you may lose up to 30% of collagen in the first 5 years of menopause, leading to visible loss of firmness and elasticity.\n\n2. Barrier Weakening: Lower estrogen means reduced ceramide production, compromising your skin's protective barrier. This leads to increased dryness, sensitivity, and trans-epidermal water loss.\n\n3. Slower Cell Turnover: Cell regeneration slows significantly, causing dullness and making it harder for skin to repair damage.\n\n4. Changes in Texture: Skin may become thinner, more fragile, and more prone to fine lines and wrinkles.\n\nThe Good News: These changes are predictable and addressable with the right approach. Our Cellular Training Rhythm is specifically designed to combat these challenges through strategic barrier support, gentle exfoliation, and targeted active ingredients that work with your skin's new reality, not against it."
