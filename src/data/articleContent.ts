When you understand your rhythm, you stop blaming yourself and start understanding yourself. Our mission is to restore that harmony through knowledge, ritual, and a system that finally makes sense."

    heroImage: '/images/phase-calm-hero.jpg',
    bodyText: "During your period (Days 1-7), the hormones estrogen and progesterone are at their lowest levels. This can cause your skin's protective barrier to weaken, leading to dryness, sensitivity, and redness. Your skin is vulnerable and needs gentle care. Our goal during this phase is not to 'attack' problems, but to soothe, hydrate, and rebuild. Think of it as a comfort blanket for your skin."

    bodyText: "During ovulation (Days 8-14), estrogen reaches its peak. Your skin is at its strongest, most resilient, and most radiant. Collagen production is optimized, and your complexion naturally glows. This is the perfect time to leverage your skin's power with active ingredients and treatments that deliver maximum results. Think of this phase as your skin's 'performance window.'"

    heroImage: '/images/phase-balance-hero.jpg',
    bodyText: "In the luteal phase (Days 15+), progesterone dominates. This hormone increases sebum production, which can lead to clogged pores, breakouts, and a heavier complexion. Your skin needs clarifying, balancing care to manage excess oil and prevent blemishes. Our goal is to keep your skin clear and balanced without stripping it."

    title: 'Ingredient Spotlight: What are Ceramides?',
    heroImage: '/images/ceramides-hero.jpg',
    bodyText: "Think of your skin cells as 'bricks.' Ceramides are the 'mortar' that holds them together. These essential lipids create a protective barrier that locks moisture in and keeps pollutants out. When this barrier is damaged, your skin becomes dry, itchy, and irritated. Our Ceramide Concentrate and Calm & Renew Serum are packed with these building blocks to physically repair your barrier and restore comfort."
